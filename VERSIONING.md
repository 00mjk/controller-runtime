# Versioning and Branching in controller-runtime

We follow the [common KubeBuilder versioning guidelines][guidelines], and
use the corresponding tooling.

For the purposes of the aforementioned guidelines, controller-runtime
counts as a "library project", but otherwise follows the guidelines
exactly.
